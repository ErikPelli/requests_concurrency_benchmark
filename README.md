# Requests Concurrency Benchmark

This repository contains the benchmark code for goroutines and locked threads, as shown in my presentation ["The rise of green threads"](https://erikpelli.pp.ua/speaker#the-rise-of-green-threads-english).

The full recording of my talk given during Devfest Venice 2024 has been uploaded to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxiZTn0dzaw), in which I explain the results obtain using this code.
